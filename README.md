# Drug-Addiction-Visualization-and-Prediction
In this project, we will work on a dataset that have different information about people ,country and also information about different drugs. We will do some important visualization to get the co-relation between young people and drug addiction. And, also use some machine learning algorithms to predict which drugs consume most.

The link to the NSDUH 2020 dataset can be found [here](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2020-nsduh-2020-ds0001).

- Dataset-03 :

Substance abuse and mental health archive (SAMHDA) collects data through multiple sources and surveys. SAMHDA goal is to provide access to public-use data files and documentation to support a better understanding of substance use disorders and mental health in United States. SAMHDA contains data for all the USA states from 2015 to 2020. This data archive has detailed information on alcohol, Tobacco, Marijuana and other drugs. The benefit of this dataset is it provides a general overview of drug consumption across the United States. The datasets can be downloaded from SAMHDA archives. The dataset is collected by Ghazal.
