# Drug-Addiction-Visualization-and-Prediction
In this project, we will work on a dataset that have different information about people ,country and also information about different drugs. We will do some important visualization to get the co-relation between young people and drug addiction. And, also use some machine learning algorithms to predict which drugs consume most.
